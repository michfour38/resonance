      "Each reflection asks you to respond honestly to carefully sequenced prompts. Not to perform growth. Not to sound wise. Just to name what is actually there.",

    "Private reflection remains private. Shared repair is chosen, not extracted. Each participant decides what they bring forward into the relationship.",
