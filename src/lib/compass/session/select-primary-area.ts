This does not mean Compass is deciding for you.

You may feel this area truly is most important right now,
or you may feel another area matters more deeply in service of the life you are trying to build.

Sometimes people speak most emotionally about:
- what hurts most,
- what feels most urgent,
- what feels most neglected,
- or what quietly supports the deeper goal beneath the surface.
